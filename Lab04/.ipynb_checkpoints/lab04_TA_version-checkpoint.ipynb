Sometimes these measurement strategies yield wildly different measurement uncertainties, so if we want a single representative data point from all the available measurements, the weighted mean can combine these measurements in a logical fashion."

    "This is $>3$, indicated we have high confidence the values are different. Again, it is likely that the calipers are slightly squishing the hair, resulting in a statistically different value of the same hair measured using two different measurement methods. As a result of this observation and the lower relative uncertainty in the laser-based weighted mean measurement, we would trust this value more to estimate the true hair diameter, i.e. the hair diameter is likely closer to 50 micrometres than the direct measurement of 40 micrometres."

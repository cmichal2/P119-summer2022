    "From our improvement round, we now have $k=139.2 \\pm 4.1 N/m$ for the small compression and $k=140.5 \\pm 2.3 N/m$ for the large compression.  With these improved measurements, our t-score is $0.28$ which is still less than one. Therefore, we are still not at all confident the large and small compressions have different $k$. In the future, we could do even better measurements to see if there is a very small hidden difference to uncover."

    "From our best round of measurements, we found that $k=139.2 \\pm 4.1 N/m$ for the small compression and $k=140.5 \\pm 2.3 N/m$ for the large compression. These values are similar to our initial round of measurements, except our relative uncertainty has decreased from $0.125$ to $0.029$ (small compression) and $0.032$ to $0.016$ (large compression). This tells us that our improvements of using maximum compressions within the allowed ranges (to directly lower uncertainty based on the $u[k]/k$ formula), as well as stabilizing the compression by using an external \"tower\" of books (to reduce $u[\\Delta x]$ and especially $u[\\Delta m]$) were successful. Taking a t-score between the two results, we find $t' = 0.28$ and so we are not at all confident the two $k$ are different because $t'<1$. From the results of our experiment, we would conclude that Hooke's law holds across the two ranges."

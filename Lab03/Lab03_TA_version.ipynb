    "Our relative uncertainty went down for both angles, so our improvement of increasing $M$ panned out. Our t-score increased to $3.11>3$, so we are now confident that the two angles have different periods. However, this is still close to $3$, so we need to do an even better measurement to see if our confidence increases further. One group saw their t-score go down from 4.2 to 3.7, but they kept $M$ unchanged and increased $N$ from 5 to 7. In any case, their t-score interpretation didn't change. Another group saw their t-score go from 0.3 to 3.3 after increasing their $M$ from 10 to 30.\n",

    "The experimental goal was to determine whether the period of a pendulum depends on its amplitude. Based on our measurements it appears that it does; our highest quality measurement yielded an average period of $1.81022 \\pm 0.00058$ s for 10 degrees and $1.81304 \\pm 0.00048$ s for 20 deg. Comparing these values gave us a t-score of 3.73, which indicates we have high confidence these two periods are different.\n",

This indicates that there is a difference, but that we need sufficiently low relative uncertainty to uncover this difference.\n",

    "Other groups had similar results: their t-scores increased beyond 3 when they increased $M$ and $N$ in an effort to reduce relative uncertainty. When we had similar $M$ and $N$ to other groups, our relative uncertainties were also similar, indicating our underlying timing uncertainty was similar as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had more time, we could increase the number of swings to something like $M=100$ to (i) further reduce our relative uncertainty and (ii) see whether air resistance or internal friction of the pendulum comes into play."

    "- The residuals plot, on the bottom, shows how far each data point is away from the model, thus the two data points that lie above the model line are shown to have positive residuals and the two below the model line are shown to have negative residuals. Three residuals are touching the $y=0$ line on the residuals graph, which is equivalent to touching the model line on the scatter plot. The residuals graph can be thought of as a zoomed-in representation of the data points as seen from the perspective of the model line."
